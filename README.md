# kotlin_attempts


My experiment with Kotlin and Swing: file manager.

To try:
1. Clone this project
2. Check that you have already installed Java SDK 11.0.3+
3. Open the project in IntelliJ Idea (community version is free)
4. Use all recommended options (e.g., use default Gradle wrapper)
5. Entry point is `src/main/kotlin/App.kt`
6. Enjoy
